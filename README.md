# Team Manager

### A MERN project where users can manage a team roster and RSVP for a 3-game series
##### From the MERN stack at Coding Dojo


Objectives:
* Set up server, model, controller, routes, and config files for server (express.js & Mongoose)
* Create a React app for frontend with hooks and components
* Tabs for adding/deleting players, and for managing player status for the game series
  * Both frontend and backend validations for adding players
  * Popup to confirm deleting players
  * Player status is 'undecided' by default, but can be changed to 'playing' or 'not playing' for each game (organized by tabs)
